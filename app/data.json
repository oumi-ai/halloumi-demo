The Tortoise replied: \n\n\"You may be as fast as the wind, but I will beat you in a race!\" \n\nThe Hare thought this idea was impossible and he agreed to the proposal. It was agreed that the Fox should choose the course and decide the end. \n\nThe day for the race came, and the Tortoise and Hare started together. \n\nThe Tortoise never stopped for a moment, walking slowly but steadily, right to the end of the course. The Hare ran fast and stopped to lie down for a rest. But he fell fast asleep. Eventually, he woke up and ran as fast as he could. But when he reached the end, he saw the Tortoise there already, sleeping comfortably after her effort."

            "context": "Grant Ward's scuffed shot put Town ahead before Luke Varney rolled the ball into an empty net after QPR keeper Alex Smithies miscued a clearance. Cole Skuse's long-range shot fell to Tom Lawrence, who capped the scoring with a calm finish into the corner. Rangers offered little in attack, but sub Sandro headed Tjarron Cherry's corner against the post late on. Ipswich had failed to score in seven of their previous 10 Championship games, but could have had plenty more, with Christophe Berra heading wide from six yards, and Skuse firing a volley straight at Smithies. The Rs have won only once in their last six matches away from Loftus Road, and rarely looked like improving that record in Ian Holloway's second game in charge. The win lifted Mick McCarthy's Ipswich up four places to 14th and above Rangers, who slipped to 15th. Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: \"The irony was that poor old Alex Smithies cost them the second goal which set us up to win as comprehensively as we did. He then kept it from being an embarrassing scoreline, but I'll take three. \"With Luke Varney and also Jonathan Douglas, I knew what I was going to get - even though I bet some people weren't thinking that when they saw the teamsheet. Luke epitomised everything what I want in this team. \"We have not been bristling with confidence. I have had a couple of rotten weekends after Rotherham and Nottingham Forest. But hopefully Ipswich can be a happier place than it has been.\" QPR boss Ian Holloway:  \"I am sure everyone will say everything hinged on the second goal, but it shouldn't have. \"The goal was a calamity and after that we were awful and it could have been four or five. \"Everyone will blame my keeper but I won't as my defenders should have made an angle for him. Even with my legs, I would have ran back and tried to help him. \"My players need to be mentally tougher as a group. I am disappointed with how we finished today. We have got to try and be a bigger, braver and more solid team.\" Match ends, Ipswich Town 3, Queens Park Rangers 0."
